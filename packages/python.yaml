  Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with
  dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic
  typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development,
  as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
