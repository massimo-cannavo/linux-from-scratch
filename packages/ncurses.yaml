description: |
  The ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation of curses in
  System V Release 4.0 (SVr4), and more. It uses terminfo format, supports pads
  and color and multiple highlights and forms characters and function-key mapping,
  and has all the other SVr4-curses enhancements over BSD curses. SVr4 curses became
  the basis of X/Open Curses.
