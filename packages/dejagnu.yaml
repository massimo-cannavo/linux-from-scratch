  DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs. Its purpose is to provide a
  single front end for all tests. Think of it as a custom library of Tcl procedures
  crafted to support writing a test harness. A test harness is the testing infrastructure
  that is created to support a specific program or tool. Each program can have multiple
  testsuites, all supported by a single test harness.
