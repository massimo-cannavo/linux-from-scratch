  Sed (stream editor) is a non-interactive command-line text editor. Sed is
  commonly used to filter text, i.e., it takes text input, performs some operation
  (or set of operations) on it, and outputs the modified text. Sed is typically
  used for extracting part of a file using pattern matching or substituting
  multiple occurrences of a string within a file.
