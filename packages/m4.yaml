  GNU M4 is a macro processor in the sense that it copies its input to the output
  expanding macros as it goes. Macros are either builtin or user-defined and can
  take any number of arguments. Besides just doing macro expansion, m4 has builtin
  functions for including named files, running UNIX commands, doing integer arithmetic,
  manipulating text in various ways, recursion etc. M4 can be used either as a front-end
  to a compiler or as a macro processor in its own right.
