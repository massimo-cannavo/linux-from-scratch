description: |
  GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed
  integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers. There is no practical
  limit to the precision except the ones implied by the available memory in the
  machine GMP runs on. GMP has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a
  regular interface.
