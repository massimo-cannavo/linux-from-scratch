  Texinfo is the official documentation format of the GNU project. It is used by
  many non-GNU projects as well. Texinfo uses a single source file to produce output
  in a number of formats, both online and printed (HTML, PDF, DVI, Info, DocBook, LaTeX,
  EPUB 3). This means that instead of writing different documents for online information
  and another for a printed manual, you need write only one document.
