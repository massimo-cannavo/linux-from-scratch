  GNU gettext is an important step for the GNU Translation Project, as it is an
  asset on which we may build many other steps. This package offers to programmers,
  translators, and even users, a well integrated set of tools and documentation.
  Specifically, the GNU gettext utilities are a set of tools that provides a framework
  to help other GNU packages produce multi-lingual messages. These tools include a set
  of conventions about how programs should be written to support message catalogs, a
  directory and file naming organization for the message catalogs themselves, a runtime
  library supporting the retrieval of translated messages, and a few stand-alone programs
  to massage in various ways the sets of translatable strings, or already translated strings.
