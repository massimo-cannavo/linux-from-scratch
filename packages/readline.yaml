  The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications
  that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and vi
  editing modes are available. The Readline library includes additional functions
  to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit
  those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
