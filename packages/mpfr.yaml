description: |
  The MPFR library is a C library for multiple precision floating-point computations
  with correct rounding. The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple
  precision floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a well-defined
  semantics. MPFR is based on the GMP multiple precision library.
