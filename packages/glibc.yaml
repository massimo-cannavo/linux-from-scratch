  The GNU C Library project provides the core libraries for the GNU system and
  GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux as the kernel.
  These libraries provide critical APIs including ISO C11, POSIX.1-2008, BSD,
  OS-specific APIs and more. These APIs include such foundational facilities as
  open, read, write, malloc, printf, getaddrinfo, dlopen, pthread_create, crypt,
  login, exit and more.
