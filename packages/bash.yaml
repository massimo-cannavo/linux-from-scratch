description: |
  Bash is the GNU Project's shell—the Bourne Again Shell. This is an sh-compatible
  shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell
  (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools
  standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive
  use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.
