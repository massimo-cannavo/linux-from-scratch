description: |
  Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated context-free
  grammar into a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) parser employing LALR(1) parser
  tables. As an experimental feature, Bison can also generate IELR(1) or canonical LR(1)
  parser tables. Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use it to develop a wide range
  of language parsers, from those used in simple desk calculators to complex programming
  languages.
